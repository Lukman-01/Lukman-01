## About Me

Hi, I’m **Lukman** — a blockchain developer and security researcher with a passion for making smart contracts safer.

I focus on **smart contract auditing**, using my experience with **Solidity** and **Cairo** to work across **Ethereum** and **Starknet**. I love digging into code, finding vulnerabilities before they become problems, and helping projects launch with confidence. Along the way, I’ve built a solid track record in security reviews, performance optimization, and architecture checks that keep blockchain systems reliable and secure.
